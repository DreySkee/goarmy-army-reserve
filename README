# Running the project

You will want to run two consoles, the first builds LESS and JS, second will have the server running.

```

To start the node web server run:

```bash
gulp serve
```

To watch chages in LESS and JS run:

gulp watch
```



# CQ integration

URLs

CSS - added step to gulp less task that adds ../ to paths starting with /images
JS - added baseUrl constant service to determine a path to prepend to images and views. Should be passed into any controllers/directives that require a path to other assets (see app.js for example). 

Routing 

$locationProvider.html5Mode(false).hashPrefix("!");
Main url and default url are both "" (empty string)
